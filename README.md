# YADA (Yet Another Diet Assistant)

## Overview

YADA is a comprehensive command-line diet and nutrition tracking application written in Rust. Designed with software engineering best practices in mind, it employs multiple design patterns to ensure code maintainability, extensibility, and reusability. The application offers users a robust way to monitor their food intake, track calorie consumption, and analyze dietary patterns against personalized calorie targets.

## üéØ Key Features

### Comprehensive User Profile Management
- **Personal Information Tracking**: Gender, height, birth date with automatic age calculation
- **Dynamic Daily Profiles**: Weight and activity level tracking with date-specific entries
- **Multiple Calculation Methods**: Harris-Benedict and Mifflin-St Jeor formulas for accurate TDEE calculations
- **Activity Level Support**: Five levels from Sedentary to Extremely Active
- **Profile History**: Track changes over time for improved accuracy

### Advanced Food Database Management
- **Composite Pattern Implementation**: Support for both basic and composite foods
- **Basic Foods**: Simple foods with direct calorie values (e.g., apple, bread)
- **Composite Foods**: Complex foods built from multiple components (e.g., sandwich, recipes)
- **Flexible Search System**: AND/OR keyword-based searching for efficient food discovery
- **Pre-populated Database**: Extensive collection of common foods with proper categorization
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy addition of new food types and sources

### Daily Food Logging with Complete Management
- **Date-Specific Logging**: Track consumption for any date (past, present, future)
- **Fractional Servings**: Support for precise serving amounts (0.5, 1.5, etc.)
- **Interactive Log Management**: View, add, and **delete** food entries with confirmation
- **Calorie Calculations**: Automatic total calorie computation with target comparison
- **Chronological Tracking**: Timestamped entries for detailed consumption analysis

### Command Pattern with Full Undo Support
- **Complete Undo Functionality**: All data modifications can be undone
- **Command History**: Track all operations with descriptive information
- **Error Recovery**: Safe operation reversal with detailed feedback
- **Configurable History**: Bounded command stack to manage memory usage

### Robust Data Persistence
- **Repository Pattern Implementation**: Clean separation of data access from business logic
- **File-Based Storage**: Simple, portable text file format for all data
- **Automatic Data Loading**: Seamless restoration of application state on startup
- **Manual Save Options**: User-controlled data persistence with error handling
- **Data Integrity**: Robust error handling for file operations

## üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture

### Design Patterns Implementation

#### Command Pattern
- **Complete Undo/Redo System**: All data modifications encapsulated as command objects
- **Command Interface**: Consistent `execute()` and `undo()` methods across all operations
- **Command Manager**: Centralized execution with automatic undo stack management
- **Command Types**: Categorized operations (AddFood, RemoveFood, AddLog, DeleteLog, UpdateProfile)
- **Bounded History**: Configurable command stack size to prevent unlimited memory growth

#### Composite Pattern
- **Food Hierarchy**: Unified interface for basic and composite food types
- **Recursive Structure**: Composite foods can contain other composite foods
- **Automatic Calculations**: Calorie values computed recursively from components
- **Uniform Treatment**: Same interface for simple foods and complex recipes

#### Repository Pattern
- **Data Access Abstraction**: Clean separation between business logic and storage
- **Consistent CRUD Operations**: Uniform interface across all data types
- **Three Repositories**: 
  - `FoodRepository`: Food database management
  - `LogRepository`: Daily consumption tracking
  - `ProfileRepository`: User profile persistence

#### Strategy Pattern
- **Calorie Calculation Strategies**: Interchangeable algorithms for BMR/TDEE calculations
- **Runtime Selection**: Users can switch calculation methods at runtime
- **Extensible Design**: Easy addition of new calculation formulas
- **Consistent Interface**: All strategies implement the same calculation contract

#### Factory Pattern
- **Calculator Factory**: Creates appropriate calorie calculation strategy instances
- **Food Source Factory**: Manages creation of different food data sources
- **Centralized Creation**: Consistent object instantiation across the application
### Core Components

### Common Issues

#### Application won't start
- Ensure Rust is properly installed: `rustc --version`
- Check if the data directory has proper permissions

#### Data not saving
- Verify write permissions to the application directory
- Try using the manual `save` command before exiting

#### Incorrect calorie calculations
- Ensure your profile information is accurate and complete
- Check if you've selected the appropriate calculation method
